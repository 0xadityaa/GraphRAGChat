### Ingredients
![](https://www.haagen-dazs.ca/sites/default/files/hdz-disclose-arrow.svg)
What is the source of dairy in _Häagen-Dazs_ ice cream? ![](https://www.haagen-dazs.ca/sites/default/files/hdz-disclose-arrow.svg)
All of our flavours are carefully crafted from 100% Canadian cow's milk. For many years, we've been proud partners of the Dairy Farmers of Ontario.
What is the source of sugar in _Häagen-Dazs_? ![](https://www.haagen-dazs.ca/sites/default/files/hdz-disclose-arrow.svg)
Our products are made with cane sugar, so artificial sweeteners are never used in our products.
Does _Häagen-Dazs_ ice cream contain any artificial colours or flavours? ![](https://www.haagen-dazs.ca/sites/default/files/hdz-disclose-arrow.svg)
We're committed to crafting the purest flavours from only the finest ingredients. This means that we never add any artificial colours or flavours to our products.
Is there alcohol in _Häagen-Dazs_ ice cream? ![](https://www.haagen-dazs.ca/sites/default/files/hdz-disclose-arrow.svg)
Alcohol is not something that most people associate with ice cream, but there are times when ethyl alcohol may be part of the vanilla flavours used. We first and foremost, always recommend checking the ingredients and nutritional facts on the label for the most accurate information.  
  
Additionally, some of our ice cream contains ingredients or flavours which use alcohol as carriers. For alcohol-free _Häagen-Dazs_ flavours, try Strawberry, Chocolate, Matcha and Coffee.
Where is _Häagen-Dazs_ ice cream made? ![](https://www.haagen-dazs.ca/sites/default/files/hdz-disclose-arrow.svg)
All _Häagen-Dazs_ ice cream is made locally in our London, Ontario factory. The one exception is our Non-Dairy collection, which is currently imported from the U.S.

Currently, all of our cartons are 100% recyclable and we're committed to making the remainder of our packaging fully recyclable or reusable by 2025. While there is still work to be done, there has been a considerable amount of progress in ensuring that we find the right balance between the adequate and minimal amount of plastics used to package our products safely, as well as the recovery of plastic at the end of its useful life.
What other environmental initiatives is _Häagen-Dazs_ leading? ![](https://www.haagen-dazs.ca/sites/default/files/hdz-disclose-arrow.svg)
A key sustainability initiative of the _Häagen-Dazs_ production team is our guarantee that zero waste will go to landfill when crafting our ice cream. Essentially, we do not send any waste from our London, Ontario factory to landfill. We have an extensive recycling program, and whatever food waste does not get composted, is sent to local farms.
