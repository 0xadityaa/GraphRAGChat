Each NESTLÉ SMARTIES Pouch (130 g) contains the delicious, classic combination of milk chocolate covered in a vibrant candy shell that's been a Canadian favourite for over 80 years. This handy pouch makes it easy to share and take on-the-go – perfect for putting out for guests at the next party, mixing into baking creations, or taking on a family trip. Made with sustainably sourced cocoa, these colourful delights are made with natural colours and flavours. Plus, they're produced in a peanut-free facility. And now, all SMARTIES packaging is made with paper, as part of the SMARTIES initiative to create a more colourful world for our children. This will help remove up to 26 tonnes of plastic packaging in Canada!
The only question is, DO YOU EAT THE RED ONES LAST?
