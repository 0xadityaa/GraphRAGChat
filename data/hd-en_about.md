### Four Simple Ingredients
![](https://www.haagen-dazs.ca/sites/default/files/hdz-disclose-arrow.svg)
Since day one, _Häagen-Dazs_ has been committed to taking the purest, responsibly-sourced ingredients and transforming them into extraordinary ice cream experiences.
Each _Häagen-Dazs_ flavour starts with four simple ingredients – real cream, milk, eggs and sugar. To this, we add only the finest additional elements to bring each flavour to life in their own distinguishable way. We never use any artificial colours or flavours in our ice cream. 
Many of our iconic flavours, like Chocolate, Coffee, Strawberry and Vanilla, contain just five ingredients. Every bite is proof that when you start with something simple, extraordinary things can happen.

### Love for Local
![](https://www.haagen-dazs.ca/sites/default/files/hdz-disclose-arrow.svg)
_Häagen-Dazs_ prides itself in the global brand that we've become, but we are just as passionate about connecting with, and staying connected to our local roots. We believe that shared value starts at home. The closer we can get to those who embrace the _Häagen–Dazs_ way, the better we can be for generations to come. 
Our love for local is reflected in our production too, as _Häagen–Dazs_ ice cream is proudly crafted in Canada. We employ 700 Canadians in our Ontario factory, united by a shared passion and a vision of excellence. To top things off, we use 100% Canadian dairy in all of our ice cream.

### Artisanal Craft
![](https://www.haagen-dazs.ca/sites/default/files/hdz-disclose-arrow.svg)
Creating extraordinary ice cream takes years of both practice and passion. For _Häagen-Dazs_ , it's been sixty of these years, and counting.
Our founder, Reuben Mattus founded _Häagen-Dazs_ with a vision to create a new decadent ice cream experience. His devotion to quality has forever changed the way people think about it.
Extraordinary ice cream, by _Häagen-Dazs_ standards, is the perfect blend of unforgettable flavours and creamy textures. Iconic flavours that have stood the test of time, revolutionary flavours that offer a new sensory experience, and velvety, rich textures that make every bite irresistible. The only way to do this, is to craft artisanally.

There's nothing we love more than creating that feeling of delight we all experience when enjoying a simple spoon of _Häagen-Dazs_.
Every flavour is churned with that exact moment in mind – from the blissful satisfaction that accompanies each first bite, to the special moments shared with loved ones while enjoying _Häagen-Dazs_. 
Creating these extraordinary feelings and memories is our livelihood, and if we can do this successfully, then we've done our job. After all, half of our story is your story.

## Thät’s Dazs
_Häagen-Dazs_ has been passionately crafting extraordinary ice cream for 60 years. 
Since day one, we’ve strived to transform the highest quality, carefully-sourced ingredients into the creamiest textures and the most decadent flavours. Our founder, Reuben Mattus, was a firm believer in creating ice cream like no other. So that’s exactly what we did, and this is how it happened.
But there’s more to our story. The _Häagen-Dazs_ experience isn’t just about indulging in the most irresistible flavours. It’s about immersing yourself in the best moments that life has to offer. Large or small, shared or sole, there is something special to be found in every moment. And when you let yourself go and find yourself in one of these moments – Thät’s Dazs.
### 1960
#### Where it all started
Reuben Mattus had a vision to change the world of ice cream. Using only the finest ingredients, his rich and velvety ice cream created an entirely new experience. With three simple flavours - Vanilla, Chocolate and Coffee - the _Häagen-Dazs_ brand was born.
### 1966
#### The perfect strawberry
Mattus set his sights on strawberry, and like the rest of his ingredients, tolerated zero compromise. After six years of searching for the perfect berry, it remains a fan favourite to this day.
### 1976
#### Brooklyn’s Brick and Mortar
Reuben’s daughter opens the first _Häagen-Dazs_ shop in Brooklyn Heights. It still stands to serve Brooklynites on Montague Street today.

On Valentine’s Day, the bar was introduced. A whole new line to love. These Vanilla Milk bars combined the creamy vanilla ice cream that _Häagen-Dazs_ fans have loved for years, with an irresistible milk chocolate coating.
### 1988
#### All new almond
Two years after the introduction of bars, a new one arrived. Creamy vanilla ice cream teamed up with a crunchy almond coating, to deliver a new obsession to the _Häagen-Dazs_ community.
### 1998
#### Exploration. Inspiration. Innovation.
Seeking inspiration caused the brand to stumble upon Dulce de Leche in South America. The result, a taste that took you away, and a flavor that would become synonymous with the _Häagen-Dazs_ brand name.
### 2008
#### Donation to pollination
When bees were faced with an uphill battle, _Häagen-Dazs_ had no choice but to help. To date, more than $1,000,000 has been donated to support the honey bees that support our ingredients.

_Häagen-Dazs_ falls in love with the creamy texture of Gelato. Unable to resist, we brought our own Italian flair to the freezer.
