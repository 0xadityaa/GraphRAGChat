As part of the registration process, a personalized, unique profile (including a username and password) will be created that will enable us to provide you with Rewards (defined below) and for you to see certain information regarding your relationship with us. Your membership in myNestlé has no cash value and is not transferrable.
  3. ### 3. Rewards
From time to time, we may provide you with offers, promotions or unique experiences (“Rewards”) via myNestlé.

Rewards are personal to you, are not transferrable and may be redeemed only in Canada. The number, type and frequency with which we may provide you Rewards are dependent upon a number of factors, which we may change at any time in our sole discretion, including, without limitation, the number and types of activities you engage in within our online properties, the frequency of your usage of myNestlé, the type and extensiveness of your participation in other Nestlé programs or applications.
