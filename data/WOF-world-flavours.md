##  Sharing food & Sharing culture 
While we’ve all grown up with different cuisines and a world of flavours, we can always find a way to connect with others by sharing a meal together. Whether you’re enjoying traditional dishes from your own family or entertaining friends with a new recipe from a city across the world - food has the power to nourish and enlighten us about different cultures. 
###  As a global company with over 2,000 brands, Nestlé products are used in a variety of ways around the world.
