**Q. Does the voucher include other Nestlé businesses?**
These vouchers do not apply to Nestlé Purina, Nespresso, Starbucks® Coffee at Home or Nestlé Professional. 
**Q. Does the voucher expire? When can I use it?**
Please keep in mind that our coupons are generally valid for a period of at least 5-6 months and should be redeemed within that timeframe. 
**Q. Do Nestlé Canada manufacturing vouchers have to be used all at once or can it be used multiple times?**
The manufacturing voucher is of one-time use. They cannot be redeemed multiple times and only apply to one purchase.
**Q. How to know if the product being purchased is a Nestlé Canada product?**
It is important to note that Nestlé is an international corporation with many products world wide. Although some Nestlé products may be found in Canadian stores, they may be coming from other markets (such as Nestlé USA).
Here are some tips on how to determine if a Nestlé product is manufactured, produced or imported by Nestlé Canada.
  1. **Nestlé Canada will be printed on the packaging.** We recommend that you consult the back of the label of the product. Our products will mention “Nestlé Canada” as either the manufacturing or importing company.
  2. **Language.** The packaging will be in English & French.
  3. **Website.** You can also consult our official Canadian website [https://www.madewithnestle.ca](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madewithnestle.ca%2F&data=05%7C01%7CGabrielle.Bonin%40ca.nestle.com%7C6b2a05acdc924a22cf2408db6787a219%7C12a3af23a7694654847f958f3d479f4a%7C0%7C0%7C638217604455452982%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xWhe7EkQcX%2FsmJNhDBhkb%2BmpGRraG9j44INJPCdAhyQ%3D&reserved=0) for our available brands and products.


Note: Product from other markets may be found on our corporate website: [https://www.nestle.com](https://www.nestle.com/)
**Q. What to do if a retailer is refusing the Nestlé Canada manufacturing voucher?**
Our vouchers should be accepted at most major retailers. If you are experiencing the refusal of a voucher this could be for a variety of reasons:
  * Damage or torn voucher
  * Voucher passed expiry date
  * Attempt to redeem on Nestlé products from another market
  * Store coupon policies


Ultimately, coupon acceptance is at the discretion of the retailer. If you are having difficulty claiming your voucher, please speak to the Front Store Manager who should be able to address any questions or concerns regarding the refusal of the voucher.
