**Vitamin Fun for Little Ones: Exploring the Benefits of Kids' Gummy Vitamins**
  
  

As children grow, it’s very important to receive the correct amount of vitamins and minerals for their optimal development and everyday wellbeing.
  
  

Ideally children would get most of the nutrients they require from the diet. However, many kids do not always make the most nutritious food choices and up to 50% of children are fussy eaters. This can limit the intake of foods such as fruit and vegetables which are the richest sources of vitamin C.1
  
  

Vitamin D, the “sunshine vitamin” is only found in the diet in small amounts and we rely on exposure to sunlight as our main source. It’s important to protect our children’s skin from the sun’s UV rays and be out of the sun during hot weather.
