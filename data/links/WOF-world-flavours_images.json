Noodles are economical to produce and could be dried and kept for long periods of time. The amount of rice used to make noodles was 50 per cent of what would be consumed if it was eaten unprocessed, so noodles essentially doubled Thailand’s rice stores. Colorful vegetables stir-fried with rice noodles and a lip-smacking sauce make this a delicious and easy alternative to take-out.\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.

Noodles are economical to produce and could be dried and kept for long periods of time. The amount of rice used to make noodles was 50 per cent of what would be consumed if it was eaten unprocessed, so noodles essentially doubled Thailand’s rice stores. Colorful vegetables stir-fried with rice noodles and a lip-smacking sauce make this a delicious and easy alternative to take-out.\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.
