Unlike American- and European-style short ribs, which include a thick slice of bone-in beef, Korean-style short ribs are cut lengthwise across the rib bone. The lengthwise cut helps to soak up the rich, Korean flavor–infused coffee marinade and serves to help grill it up quickly.\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.

The amount of rice used to make noodles was 50 per cent of what would be consumed if it was eaten unprocessed, so noodles essentially doubled Thailand’s rice stores. Colorful vegetables stir-fried with rice noodles and a lip-smacking sauce make this a delicious and easy alternative to take-out.\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.
